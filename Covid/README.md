Link to Dataset: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

I split the table into two: 

•	Covid Deaths

•	Covid Vaccinations

Backed up the raw data and started working on the copy

Imported to Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio for querying

Analyzed the data and made tables/SQL views for:

o	Total Cases vs total deaths in each location

o	Checked the above for Switzerland alone

o	Countries with highest infection rate compared to their population

o	Countries with highest number of death compared to their population

o	Checked the same measures by continent 

o	Comparison of total population vs vaccinated people in each location

Imported the SQL views to Tableau

Made individual charts for each peipce of info

Combined all charts and made the dashboard

Finalized the dashboard formatting

Saved and put in public tableau
